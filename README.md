# imfit-MCMC

## Introduction 
This software is created to automate the flux density, and source size of stacked radio galaxies. This is done by fitting the radio stacked image to a two dimensional (2D) Gaussian model using Bayesian Inference. From the resulting fit, the flux density and source size are calculatied analytically.

### Requirements:

ILIFU cluster

### To run
python Mastercode.py Params.ini
